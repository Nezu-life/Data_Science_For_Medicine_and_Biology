# Example variables
patient_age1 = 30
patient_age2 = 40
dosage_mg1 = 50
dosage_mg2 = 75

# Addition: Calculating the total age of two patients
total_age = patient_age1 + patient_age2

# Subtraction: Finding the age difference between two patients
age_difference = patient_age2 - patient_age1

# Multiplication: Calculating total dosage for two different medications
total_dosage = dosage_mg1 * dosage_mg2

# Division: Calculating the average age of the two patients
average_age = total_age / 2

# Printing the results
print("Total age of two patients:", total_age)
print("Age difference between two patients:", age_difference)
print("Total dosage for two medications:", total_dosage)
print("Average age of two patients:", average_age)
